<h1>About Me</h1>

<p>I’m a GIS specialist and software developer with a background in environmental planning and computer science. My work sits at the intersection of spatial analysis, automation, and problem-driven application development. I enjoy turning complex geographic and technical data into tools that are efficient, maintainable, and useful to real people. </p>

<p>I have extensive experience working with ArcGIS Pro, ArcPy, and the ArcGIS Python API, building workflows that automate spatial analysis, raster processing, suitability modeling, and feature class management. Many of my projects focus on performance, scalability, and clarity—whether that’s optimizing geoprocessing scripts, designing scoring systems for spatial decision-making, or developing public-facing GIS applications.</p>

<p>On the software side, I work primarily in Python and Java, with additional experience in web development and ARM assembly, data structures, and algorithm design. I’m especially interested in how low-level systems knowledge can inform better high-level software design. I value readable code, thoughtful abstraction, and testing as tools for long-term maintainability.</p>

<p>I’m driven by projects that blend technical depth with real-world impact—particularly in land use, infrastructure, sustainability, and public decision-making. My goal is to build tools that not only work, but make complex systems easier to understand and use.</p>
